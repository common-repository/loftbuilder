== Description ==

> **Important Notice - updated on June 27, 2016**
> 
> We've found that one of our plugins (LoftLoader) has been stolen and was being sold on Envato last week (We have sent DMCA notice to Envato and now this item was disabled). We feel terrible about that and decide to remove our most important product - LoftBuilder (lite version) from WordPress.org after the discussion inside our team.
> 
> We have released the pro version on Envato Market. If you have any further question, please feel free to contact us directly via general@loftocean.com or visit [LoftBuilder Pro on CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/item/loftbuilder-pro-drag-drop-page-builder-for-wordpress/16767360).

LoftBuilder is a drag & drop WordPress page builder. You can build responsive layouts, add text and media, and create engaging animations and interactions. Build your site page in minutes. Without coding. 

= Intuitive = 
You can edit every element on the page directly. Type text, change column width, drag and drop to change everything’s position… You know what’s going on your page while working.

It’s not a front-end editor. It’s an editor with front-end looking. That makes your published front-end pages always keep clean, without any extra codes. 

= Works with any theme =
LoftBuilder is a flexible plugin, and it works with almost any theme. You will not lose the content when you switch themes. 

BTW, our team is working on some themes for our LoftBuilder.

= Switch published content =
You can choose which content to publish for each page: the content created in LoftBuilder editor, or the content written in WordPress default editor. So you can publish some essential/summary content while working on more details of a page.

= Unlimited Colors =
Each element and background can be set to any color you want. And to keep the look consistent throughout your site, you can set a primary accent color and apply it to element - buttons, icons, charts, maps, color overlays, and etc.

= Trending & Modern =
Compatible with modern browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge.

= Features & Options =
* 16 modules: Text, Media, Button, Icon, Accordion, and etc.
* 2 special sections: Posts and Tabs.
* 12 predefined sections with pre-designed layouts and sample content.
* Font Awesome icons are included.
* Custom background color/image for page header, sections and columns.
* Background parallax scroll effect for page header and section.
* Color overlay on top of the background image.
* Page content entrance animation.
* Individual custom CSS for each page.
* Responsive & retina ready.
* Ready for translation (.pot file included).
